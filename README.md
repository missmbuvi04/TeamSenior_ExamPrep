> [Preparation for Examination made easy with ExamReady]

## African Context

[High school students across Africa face a serious challenge when preparing for
national examinations. Quality study resources are either too expensive,
hard to find, or not structured in a way that helps students identify and
improve on their weak areas. Without access to private tutors or organized
practice materials, many students walk into high-stakes exams underprepared —
not because they lack the ability, but because they lacked the right tools.

ExamReady solves this by giving every high school student access to a free,
structured, and easy-to-use exam preparation platform where they can practice
questions, get instant feedback, and track their progress over time.]

## Project Overview

[ExamReady is a web-based exam preparation platform designed to help high school students across Africa prepare effectively for national and school-based examinations. The application provides a structured and accessible space where students can practice exam-style questions, receive instant feedback, and continuously improve their understanding of key subjects. By offering free and organized study tools, ExamReady reduces the gap between students who have access to private tutoring and those who do not.

The platform allows students to attempt quizzes based on specific topics, helping them focus on areas where they need the most improvement. After completing a quiz, students receive immediate results, including correct answers and explanations, enabling them to learn from their mistakes in real time. ExamReady also tracks student performance over time, allowing users to monitor progress, identify weak areas, and build confidence before sitting for high-stakes examinations.

Built using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MySQL for data management, ExamReady ensures a smooth and responsive user experience. The system includes a scalable question storage structure, making it easy to update and expand the question bank as new content is added. Overall, ExamReady empowers students with the right tools to practice smarter, track growth, and walk into exams fully prepared.]
