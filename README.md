### *Preparation for Examination made easy with ExamReady*

##  Problem Statement

High school students across Africa face a serious challenge when preparing for
national examinations. Quality study resources are either too expensive,
hard to find, or not structured in a way that helps students identify and
improve on their weak areas. Without access to private tutors or organized
practice materials, many students walk into high-stakes exams underprepared —
not because they lack the ability, but because they lacked the right tools.

ExamReady solves this by giving every high school student access to a free,
structured, and easy-to-use exam preparation platform where they can practice
questions, get instant feedback, and track their progress over time.
